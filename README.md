## Standalone UI Development

To develop and test the UI components (highlights) in isolation:

1.  Run `npm install` if you haven't already.
2.  Run `npm run serve:ui`.
3.  This will open a page in your browser (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `https://localhost:3000`) where you can see the mock components and test the highlighting functionality.
